- Mute command (2) not working properly, requires bot admin status
- #clear command fails to delete messages as expected
- Suggested enhancement: #clear should delete last 10 messages from user who the bot replied to
- Link sharing triggers:
  * User sending link should be deleted and blacklisted
  * Blacklisted user attempting to rejoin group should be instantly removed
  * PHONE_ALERT message needed with option to remove user from blacklist
  * Rationale: Prevents accidental permanent blacklisting
- Recommendation: Thoroughly test each function to ensure proper implementation
- Clear command (deep analysis needed): Current implementation does not actually clear messages. Requires comprehensive debugging to identify root cause of failure and implement effective message deletion mechanism
- Note on #clear: Does not clear messages, requires deep analysis to make it work correctly
