## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CommunityGuard.git
cd CommunityGuard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Download your service account key
   - Save it as `guard1-dbkey.json` in the project root

4. Configure the bot:
   - Edit `inviteMonitor.js`
   - Update `ADMIN_PHONE` and `ALERT_PHONE` with your phone numbers

5. Run the bot:
```bash
node inviteMonitor.js
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `ADMIN_PHONE`: Super admin phone number (e.g., '972555020829')
- `ALERT_PHONE`: Phone number for alerts (e.g., '972544345287')

### Firebase Collections
The bot uses the following Firestore collections:
- `whitelist`: Stores whitelisted users
- `blacklist`: Stores blacklisted users
- `muted_users`: Stores temporarily muted users
- `commands`: Stores custom commands

## Features in Detail

### WhatsApp URL Detection
When a user posts a WhatsApp group invite link:
1. The message is immediately deleted
2. The sender is kicked from the group
3. The sender is added to the blacklist
4. The group code from the URL is also blacklisted as a potential LID
5. An alert is sent to the admin with group details

### Mute System
- **Group Mute**: Restricts all members except admins from sending messages
- **User Mute**: Silently deletes messages from muted users
- **Auto-kick**: Users who send more than 3 messages while muted are automatically kicked

### LID Support
The bot fully supports WhatsApp's new @lid identifier system:
- Automatically handles both traditional phone numbers and LID formats
- Properly identifies users regardless of their identifier type
- Ensures all moderation features work with both formats

## Security Best Practices

1. **Whitelist trusted users** to prevent accidental moderation
2. **Regularly review blacklist** to ensure it's up to date
3. **Limit admin access** to trusted individuals only
4. **Monitor alerts** sent to ALERT_PHONE for suspicious activity
5. **Keep the bot updated** to ensure compatibility with WhatsApp changes

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding to commands
- Ensure the bot has admin privileges in the group
- Check that commands are typed correctly (case-insensitive)
- Verify Firebase connection is working

### Mute command shows "bot must be an admin"
- The bot's LID/phone number must have admin privileges
- Try removing and re-adding the bot as admin

### Users not being kicked
- Verify the bot has admin privileges
- Check if the target user is also an admin (admins cannot be kicked)
- Ensure the user is properly blacklisted
